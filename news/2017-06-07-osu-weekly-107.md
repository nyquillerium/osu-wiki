**After a long hiatus, [flyte](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3103765) has started doing Q&A sessions again.** For those who might be unaware, on the odd occasion, flyte used to take questions off his twitter, and answer them on the next.ppy.sh blog, however this time he’s decided to answer them live on [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/arflyte). The stream itself didn’t just cover questions from the community though, but also went over the new osu!taiko mascot Mocha, and gave some insight as to why it was picked over the other entries.

**Even being worked around the clock (literally), [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) has still found time to deliver a [new blog post](https://blog.ppy.sh/2017.609.0/) and new update for osu!lazer.** The update adds OSD (On Screen Display) support for the Raw Input and Cursor Sensitivity options, and also adds a very simple implementation of the new social browser (Online users) thanks to the hard work of [DrabWeb](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6946022).

**[HappyStick](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/256802)’s month of improvement continues as we get some fresh new interviews.** This week , we had both [WubWoofWolf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/39828) and [Axarious](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2614511) donating some of their time to sit down with happyStick and talk about the ins and outs of osu! and various other topic points.

**[-Mo-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2202163)  has released a new video going over more mapping theories.** This focus this time around is on note emphasis and how you can manipulate it using angles. The video covers ways to use angle emphasis for both circles and sliders and when each way works, Could very well be something to consider next time you’re working on a map.

**The ninth installment of the [OWCT](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/578214) has concluded with Floating up taking home first place.** The team was comprised of 8 players, including players such as [Angelsim](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1777162), [waaiiru](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/903978) and [yaong](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1883865). Floating up had a tough finals ahead of them having to first prove themselves in the lower bracket finals before getting their chance at OWCT glory. If you’d like to check up more information about the OWCT, feel free to check out the [stat sheet(https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sRcai2qpONQEoykBjaOAEHUEb_GOJ-XnN84C-kxoqRk/edit#gid=759899346).
 
 
**Youtube channel [CronixYT](https://www.youtube.com/cronixyt) has uploaded a video giving some love to an old skin by the name of [squareosu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/146382).** The premise of the skin is rather simple, replace circles, with squares, and that’s about it. However both the skin, and video have received a lot of love and attention. The simplistic idea of the skin has been enjoyed by players for years, and it’s videos like this that can keep these amazing skins known for years to come.

**Speaking of skins, [SweetMate](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4122729) has developed a [new program](http://jackvandenbrink.weebly.com/code-projects.html) designed to help mix and match skin elements you have.**You can select which elements you want to add to your new skin, say hitcircles, and then cycle through all the hitcircle files you have across your skins folder. Once you find the hitcircle you like, you can just add it to your new skin all within the comfort of the program. The program was also recently outfitted with an update checker, so if you already downloaded it, might pay to get a fresh new copy.

The arrival of the Knockout Stage saw our 32 teams of intrepid fruit catchers split in two, with only 16 countries advancing to this past weekend’s Round of 16 in a series of head-to-head food fights for supremacy. Whilst the double elimination format of the tournament means that none of the remaining teams have been sent home yet, the battle lines have most certainly been drawn. Which teams remain in the relative safety of the winner’s bracket, and which are clinging on by the skin of their teeth? Read on to find out!
 
The Round of 16 mappool ramped up the difficulty another notch, whilst maintaining a similar balance of specific osu!catch and converted osu!standard difficulties. Also, we saw a rise in popularity for Hidden and DoubleTime picks, the most popular being Spectator’s [Memme - Cherry Blossom](https://osu.ppy.sh/b/1047736&m=2) +DT with 6 picks over the 8 matches. The players’ catcher control was put to a stern test throughout, most noticeably on the Hidden pick [M2U - A Bella!](https://osu.ppy.sh/b/1147348&m=2), which saw an average accuracy dipping down to 97.98%.

Hong Kong once again opened the show, this time facing off against one of the tournament favourites in South Korea. The Hong Kong team put up a valiant fight, narrowly missing out in their first two games, the second of which being decided by only 539 points, but as the cracks began to seep in, the Korean team stayed rock solid, convincingly winning each of the remaining games to seal the match 5-0.
 
Battle continued between Poland and China, who made the curious tactical decision to finish as runners-in in their Group G, in anticipation of an easier side of the draw. A similar series of narrow victories for the Chinese team opened the score up to 3-0 before Poland managed to land a return blow on the HardRock pick [Koi Yomi Zakura (Full Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/b/46587&m=2). Sadly for the TieBreaker hungry crowd, China would emphatically blast back in their next two games to finish 5-1 to the better.
 
Romania next looked to continue their impressive debut World Cup performance against last year’s runners-up, Indonesia. After seeing a handy lead on their first pick, [Kurobukko vs yukitani - Minimachita EVOLVED](https://osu.ppy.sh/b/1100300) dramatically evaporate in the final moments to an incredible final spinner by Deceitful, the Romanian team appeared to lose confidence, and despite a couple of spirited attempts to fight back, their remaining four games fell to the Indonesians with a final score of 5-0. They will rue Deceitful in particular as a thorn in their side, who appeared almost unstoppable as he racked up a double S in all five games of the match. Yes - every single one.

A pair of crushing clean sweep victories by Taiwan and Japan over their respective opponents Argentina and Mexico, respectively, concluded the first block of matches, with the action returning in the afternoon session with the Chile taking on The Netherlands. The Commentators and fans alike were almost perfectly divided as to who would emerge the victor here, and these two evenly matched teams certainly did not disappoint, serving up a truly epic duel. 

Each team won their respective picks for the first three rounds of the match, with The Netherlands achieving a narrow escape of only 2,027 points on their third pick, the endurance-focused [CLIFF EDGE feat. Nakamura Maiko - The Distance](https://osu.ppy.sh/b/1053163). The Netherlands finally achieved a break in the 7th game, but were unable to capitalize as Chile immediately stormed back to tie the game up at 4 points apiece. As if written in the destinies from the very beginning, the tiebreaker hype was finally realised, with the Dutch team narrowly emerging the victors.
 
After seeing Sweden capitalise on an inconsistent United Kingdom side to finish 5-2 in front, the final match of the day was a year in the making, featuring a hotly anticipated repeat of the 2016 semi-final between Germany and The United States. A freak keyboard malfunction for qebrus cost the United States’ their first game on [Reol - No title](https://osu.ppy.sh/b/536479), but after this there was no looking back as Germany capitulated to a crushing 5-1 defeat at the hands of the Americans, who will no doubt be celebrating some hard-earned revenge at the expense of their long-time rivals. Of particular note in the match was an impressive “double double S” for United States’ players Sponge and Zak on the tricky hyperdash-less Hidden pick [Hecq - Dstrukt](https://osu.ppy.sh/b/1087385&m=2).
